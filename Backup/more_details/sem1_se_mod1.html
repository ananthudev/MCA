                    <p>Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development
                        of software. Software engineering is a computing discipline.
                        <br>
                        Software is a program or set of programs containing instructions which provide desired
                        functionality . And Engineering is the processes of designing and building something that serves
                        a particular purpose and find a cost effective solution to problems.

                    <p>
                        Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design,
                        develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that
                        meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

                        SDLC is the acronym of Software Development Life Cycle.

                        It is also called as Software Development Process.

                        SDLC is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process.

                        ISO/IEC 12207 is an international standard for software life-cycle processes. It aims to be the
                        standard that defines all the tasks required for developing and maintaining software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists
                        of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific
                        software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the
                        overall development process.

                                        Requirement analysis is the most important and fundamental stage in SDLC. It is
                                        performed by the senior members of the team with inputs from the customer, the
                                        sales department, market surveys and domain experts in the industry. This
                                        information is then used to plan the basic project approach and to conduct
                                        product feasibility study in the economical, operational and technical areas.

                                        associated with the project is also done in the planning stage. The outcome of
                                        the technical feasibility study is to define the various technical approaches
                                        that can be followed to implement the project successfully with minimum risks.

                                        Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly define and

                                        market analysts. This is done through an SRS (Software Requirement
                                        Specification) document which consists of all the product requirements to be
                                        designed and developed during the project life cycle.

                                        SRS is the reference for product architects to come out with the best

                                        specified in SRS, usually more than one design approach for the product
                                        architecture is proposed and documented in a DDS - Design Document
                                        Specification.

                                        This DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various
                                        parameters as risk assessment, product robustness, design modularity, budget and
                                        time constraints, the best design approach is selected for the product.

                                        A design approach clearly defines all the architectural modules of the product
                                        along with its communication and data flow representation with the external and
                                        third party modules (if any). The internal design of all the modules of the
                                        proposed architecture should be clearly defined with the minutest of the details
                                        in DDS.

                                        In this stage of SDLC the actual development starts and the product is built.
                                        The programming code is generated as per DDS during this stage. If the design is
                                        performed in a detailed and organized manner, code generation can be
                                        accomplished without much hassle.

                                        a limited segment and tested in the real business environment (UAT- User
                                        acceptance testing).

                                        released in the market, its maintenance is done for the existing customer base.
